## Description
A personal website that was made to show my web projects and also to improve my front-end development skills after focusing on the back-end field too much.  
  
Apologies for the "simple-like" website as I'm still learning more about the front-end. Feel free to tell me any opinions or improvements on the site through [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/adobong_sunog/) or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/adobePhotosoup).
